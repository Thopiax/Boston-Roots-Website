    33:                     The Boston Roots mentorship program is designed to partner our students with an experienced mentor who can guide them throughout their remaining two years in high school. They provide students with the tools they need to succeed with the college application phase. It’s important to remember that our mentors were once students going through the exact same process, which is why they are in a perfect position to guide others facing the same task. As our students learn from our mentors, they collect priceless information not only on the college app but also what it takes to succeed in a university atmosphere.
